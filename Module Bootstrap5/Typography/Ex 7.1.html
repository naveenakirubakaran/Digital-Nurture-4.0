Exercise 7.1:
Create a sample page with different Bootstrap typography utilities: display-1, lead, text-muted, 
fw-bold, etc.

<div class="container mt-4">
  <h1 class="display-1">Display 1 Heading</h1>
  <p class="lead">This is a lead paragraph that stands out more.</p>
  <p class="text-muted">This text is muted and appears lighter.</p>
  <p class="fw-bold">This paragraph uses bold font weight.</p>
</div>
